I once worked for this small family owned business. The owner,( at the time I knew him), was an older fellow who emmigrated  from Russia to America as a teenager. Sometimes he would tell us about his childhood experiences, what it was like having to start over in America as well as developing and running the business. I always enjoyed his reminiscings. One of the stories he told me was about a young person who asked him for a job. He told this person "I don't have any jobs available, but if your looking for work I have plenty of that." I think that's an interesting concept. I believe he was saying,  if you're looking for something  you don't have to put alot of effort into just so you can collect a pay check, then I'm not interested in what you have to offer, but if you want something you can put your heart and soul into then I have just what you're looking for. Of course, I could have it all wrong,  maybe that was a subtle message to get me to work harder.

When I think about the most succesful people  I have met in my life, I notice  they are the ones most passionate about what they are doing. They don't mind talking (ad nauseam sometimes) about what  they are doing. That's my hope someday, to bore someone about my career as a web developer. Now that's not to say I want to be a know-it-all and tell people why I could have made a web site so much better.

Learning to code is more than just an interest, more than just a way to get a pay check. It's about learning, and how to problem solve. It's about solving puzzles and finding out  there is more than one way to find a solution. At the end of this journey of learning to code I hope to find  not only a job, but also work  I am passionate about,  find rewarding, and  can put my heart and soul into ( and get a paycheck too).
