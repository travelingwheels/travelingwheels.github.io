For me the sinatra project pulled a lot of concepts together. For example, routes, the way models are associated, and how data gets displayed on the view page, which translates into what the user see's. In comparing  the sinatra  project to the CLI project, this one is more gratifying in the sense that you can see the changes you make in a rendered web page as opposed to the command line, but it is an apple's to orange's comapison.

I didn't go overboard so my project is very simple in that it only has two models. I think because of all the turbulence in the world at the time, it was difficult to be too creative. My main motivation for the project (a movie review app) was the lockdown. All we did was stream TV shows and movies. After awhile the algorythm for new programs to watch on our streaming services  wasn't really giving us anything of interest so thought it would be nice to have other people's recomendations as to what to watch next.

As with all projects planning is key. I know there is much more to learn and I look forward to those challenges, but creating something that you could see on the web is exciting.
